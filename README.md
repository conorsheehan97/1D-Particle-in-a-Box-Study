# 1D-Particle-in-a-Box-Study

# Introduction 
This project involves a detailed study of the Quantum Mechanical 1D particle in a box scenario. Using an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, we calculate wavefunctions and energies, and employ Monte Carlo methods to determine energy levels and position operator expectation values.
